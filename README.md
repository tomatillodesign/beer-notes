# Beer Notes üç∫

Interactive journal/logging system for tracking beer, built in React

## Objective

This project was created by Chris Liu-Beers of [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com) as a fun way to practice building in React. The goal is to create an interesting way for users to track their favorite beers and get better at coding at the same time.

## Features

- Clean, clear navigation using menu tabs
- Beer, breweries, and notes are all connected and instantly updated
- Filter main "Beer" view by different criteria

## Technical Credits

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [ReactSelect](https://react-select.com/home)
- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

## To Do's

- ~~Persist state with Firebase~~
- Add authentication/security to Firebase
- Allow new users to sign up and create their own log

## Possible Refinements

- Main Beer view, add sorting by Rating (heart, thumbs up, etc.)
- Main Beer view, add transition/animations for smooth switching
- ~~Main Beer view, ensure that sorting also happens when items are tied (eg sort all beers with 0 log entries alphabetically when "High Count" is selected)~~
- ~~Main Beer view, persist the state of viewing (eg viewType: 'alphabetical')~~
