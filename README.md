# Beer Notes üç∫

Interactive journal/logging system for tracking beer, built in React

## Objective

This project was created by Chris Liu-Beers of [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com) as a fun way to practice building in React. The goal is to create an interesting way for users to track their favorite beers and get better at coding at the same time.

## Features

- Personalized Journal for each visitor
- Basic suite of account tools (registration, lost password, etc.)
- Clean, clear navigation using menu tabs
- Beer, breweries, types of beer, and journal entries are all connected and instantly updated
- Filter main "Beer" view by different criteria

## Technical Credits

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [ReactSelect](https://react-select.com/home)
- [React Flip Toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit)
- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

## To Do's

- Advanced filter views (eg view only IPA's, or beers from a specific state, ABV range, etc.)
- Sticky footer to bottom of page
- Fix CSS quirks
- Mobile-friendly
- Clean up code, remove console logs, etc.
- ~~More clear registration directions~~
- ~~Prevent empty log entry from being added accidentally~~
- ~~Add beer type to dropdown select (including ability to add your own)~~
- ~~Main Beer view, add transition/animations for smooth switching~~
- ~~Upon loading, if user is already logged in, go straight to the Tabs~~
- ~~Persist state with Firebase~~
- ~~Add authentication/security to Firebase~~
- ~~Allow new users to sign up and create their own log~~

## Possible Refinements

- ~~Main Beer view, add sorting by Rating (heart, thumbs up, etc.)~~
- ~~Main Beer view, ensure that sorting also happens when items are tied (eg sort all beers with 0 log entries alphabetically when "High Count" is selected)~~
- ~~Main Beer view, persist the state of viewing (eg viewType: 'alphabetical')~~
